-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- To Do -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

    --CHANGE

* change movement: add deceleration that runs constantly over acceleration (for smoother movement)
* executable file (..?)
* refactor code 

    --ADD

* Map and tile managing:
    -> tiles would need more robust way of handling the texture to get the right sprite
    -> tile layers if I want to display multiple things on the same game
    -> render only tiles in view 
    -> 
* Propper collision detection and handling:
    -> player can fall in pits or be blocked by walls 
    -> 
* States
    -> game_state, menu, inventory, game_over
    -> and rewrite inputs and game class to handle game menu
    -> later on... entity state
    -> 
* SOUND refined

* Texturing 101: 
    * wrap borders around the rooms both on top and bottom (2 styles/level is fine)
        -> a small portion of rooms that don't have wall borders have pit borders instead
        -> some borders can come as carpet filling
    * floor textures ( IMPORTANT ! WHAT IS THE THEME OF THE LEVEL?? )
        1) carpet, stone, wood
        2) broken - carpet, stone, wood
        3) cobble, wood, stone + some polish here and there
    * walls are just the same for texture types 
        -> wall top borders feel like a horizontal cut-out in wall texture 
        -> wall = 2x player size
        -> walls that separate rooms have one texture for border and another for fill black

    * there is some sort of transsitionning between level styles (generally not very drastic in terms of materials)

    * lots of crates, boxes, stuff you can destroy

    * some rooms are always the same in terms of texturing

    * typical room size = 25-30 tiles
