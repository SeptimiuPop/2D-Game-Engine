-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- To Do -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

    --CHANGE

* change movement: add deceleration that runs constantly over acceleration (for smoother movement)
* change user input to be handled in the Handler class and link the return msg to some action
* change includce statements to the corect way
    -> figure out how they work on a basic level (ask Agi..?)
    -> executable file (..?)

    --ADD

* Map and tile managing:
    -> tiles would need more robust way of handling the texture to get the right sprite
    -> tile layers if I want to display multiple things on the same game
    -> render only tiles in view 
    -> 
* Propper collision detection and handling:
    -> player can fall in pits or be blocked by walls

4 Mar/2021:

    * new standard include files (like the tutorials) --had to change run.sh and all the includes

















As I kept refining my program a bit before moving to the next iteration I was faced with a few decision so I have a couple of questions:

I am using gnu g++ compiler and a regular code editor in which I feel comfortable (no IDE ). The program is run on ubuntu. 

1) Do I need to have an executable file or hould a bash script for running and compiling work as well. If it does should I add an instalation script for the necessary libraries (for SFML and other external files) as well? Idealy I would like to include them directly in the project folder so there wouldn't be a need to add the install script, but I was unsuccessful so far. 

2) Again reguarding the compilation process I have attached a folder with two examples. The first one is a sample of my current setup of my includes and the second one is the one I find the most on the internet. I am starting to realize my setup might not be the best but the lack of a definite answer in my search is causing me some confusion.

* compiling only cpp classes -> do I have to compile header files as well
* if I use the second example I am unable to create instances of other objects in header file
